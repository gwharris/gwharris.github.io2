BRAINSTORMING:

--- STORY ---
Something D&D-like, with monsters and magic

--- GAMEPLAY ---
Something like the web game "A Dark Room" 

Option to start the game as different classes? Maybe choose 3?
- thief (chance for a critical attack? should all classes get critical chance?)
- knight (extra health?)
- mage (extra attack? ability to heal?)
Each class gets a slight boon of some kind (mage gets more magic, warrior has extra health, etc)

Turn based? Monsters have a set damage output, health, and defense?

Characters start with 5 HP, 1 ATK, 1 DEF, and after each successful round can boost 1 stat

Monsters get progressively more powerful after each stages
- should some monsters be "bosses" with specific skills?
- should monsters be semi-random from a set?

--- STYLE ---
A text-only adventure (or minimal graphics) with a set number of stages

Choose your adventurer and go fight!

Before each stage, give a bit of the story (kind of like the pages in choose your own adventure)

Choice of left or right? Linear story?
