# Get ready for an adventure!

<b>Code and story by Graham Harris</b>

## Welcome to Unafraid!
Start your journey in a strange land filled with magical creatures and deadly adversaries. Will you make it to the end or will some ill misfortune befall you?\
\
The game is a simple text adventure that allows players to make choices as they play. Similar to "Choose Your Own Adventure" style books/games, the player typically makes one of two choices, but unlike those books/games, players are not guaranteed to survive to see the end of their decisions.\
\
The game is hosted [here](https://gwharris.github.io/).
